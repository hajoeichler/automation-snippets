# Automation Snippets

This is a collection of small shell scripts used in continous integration/deployment/delivery environments.

## Why

When using eg Jenkins as CI software the job configurations should be as small and dump as possible - one line shell scripts are the best!

Further, everything that can be triggered from those kind of CI software should be also be triggered from command line.

## Content

* clone-or-pull
